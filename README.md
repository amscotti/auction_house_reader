# Auction House Reader
Having fun with Nim and the battle.net API, really nothing more then just some code to help learn Nim.

## Build
Get your own API key for battle.net, and update the line for `ApiKey = "<YOUR API KEY>"`. If you want another realm beside Staghelm, update the line with `let realm = "Staghelm"` to the realm you want.

Then run, `nim c auction_house_reader.nim`

## Running
`./auction_house_reader`
